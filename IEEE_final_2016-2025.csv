Software defect prediction is an important method for finding defects and can help developers improve their testing efficiency. To build accurate prediction models, previous software defect prediction techniques focus on design of functions related to the code of potential defects. But these methods do not adequately capture the semantic features of the program. In this paper, we propose a software defect prediction model based on program slice and deep learning. We extract program slice based on system dependence graph and leverage Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to generate features. We conducted experiments both within-project defect prediction and cross-project defect prediction using the dataset of the public PROMISE database. The results show that our method improves on average by 11.0% in F1-measure in within-project and 10.4% in F1-measure in cross-project defect prediction compared to the Tree-LSTM method.","2637-9430","978-1-7281-6607-0","10.1109/ICCCN49398.2020.9209658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9209658","program slice;deep learning;software defect prediction","Software;Predictive models;Logic gates;Machine learning;Semantics;Neural networks;Data models","","13","","22","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software defect prediction's main aim is to find out various bugs present in software and focus on testing efforts. Many of existing software defect prediction frameworks are much simple, making it difficult for developers to get detailed reference information. Nowadays, many deep learning models, like the Radial Base Functional Neural Network(RBF) and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are applied to features which are created automatically from deep learning models and abstract syntax trees (AS Ts) to aid in the improved performance of predicting defects. But the results generated using RBF and CNN algorithms are not able to provide much accuracy due to its restricted size of dataset and improper baseline selections. To resolve these state-of-the-art problems, we have constructed a dataset taken from various defect datasets namely the Kamei Dataset, NASA Dataset and the PROMISE Source Code (PSC) dataset. In this research, the dataset is named as Combination Defect Analysis Dataset (CDA). Then, an Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (ECNN) model is proposed for predicting defects in Intra-Project software (IPDP) and associated results to different models.

Practitioners usually need this measure during software development process or during a period of operation to indicate the reliability of software system. However, since predicting defect density before testing the modules is time consuming, managers need to build a prediction model that can help in detecting the defective modules. This process can reduce the testing cost and improve testing resources utilizations. The most intrinsic feature of software defect datasets is the data sparsity in the defect density which might bias the final prediction. Therefore, we use deep learning to build defect density prediction models and handle the inherit challenge of data sparsity in defect density. Deep learning has shown to be effective with sparse data. The constructed model has been evaluated against well-known machine learning methods over 28 public datasets.

Many researchers have proposed various JIT models, but it is difficult to find a case in which JIT defect prediction was performed on edge computing applications. In particular, due to the characteristic of self-driving software, which is frequently updated, there is a high risk of inducing defects into the update process.

This research suggests using an optimized deep learning (DL) model with an oversampling technique to predict software defeat early to address these problems. The proposed system mainly comprises three phases: dataset balancing, parsing source code, and classification. To begin, the dataset imbalance issue is solved with the help of k-means clustering and synthetic minority oversampling technique (KMSMOTE). After that, the source code is parsed using the AST, which converts the source code into tokens. Finally, the classification is done using the Sand Cat Optimized Recurrent Neural Network (SCRNN) approach to classify the input into the defect or non-defect, in which the hyperparameters are optimally chosen using the Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO) algorithm and the NIPUNA activation function solves the gradient vanishing problem. Tests conducted on the NASA dataset demonstrate that the system attains an average accuracy of 96.21%, confirming that the suggested model has good prediction performance and can lower the cost of misclassification and mitigate the effects of sample class imbalance.","","979-8-3503-8793-3","10.1109/IC457434.2024.10486399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10486399","Software Defeat Prediction;NASA;Dataset balancing;Abstract Syntax Tree;and Deep Learning","Deep learning;Support vector machines;Costs;Source coding;Computational modeling;NASA;Software quality","","2","","15","IEEE","4 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early approaches for software defect prediction relied on statistical approaches to classify software modules and decide whether each module is a defect-prone module or not. Lately, many researchers used machine learning techniques to train a model that can classify software modules to defect-prone modules and not defect-prone modules. Starting from the new millennium, neural networks and deep learning won many competitions in machine learning applications. However, the use of deep learning to build a software defect prediction model was not investigated thoroughly.

Nevertheless, as recent research has demonstrated, creating defective prediction models is a challenging issue. Several research methods for predicting source code defects have been proposed over time. However, the majority of previous research has concentrated on traditional feature extraction and modelling. Traditional methods frequently fail to locate the contextual information needed to build reliable prediction deep learning models in source code files. On the other hand, defect prediction semantic feature techniques have only lately changed and advanced. Using such techniques, it would be possible to forecast suspicious problems by automatically extracting contextual information from source code files. We suggest employing deep learning, a potent representation-learning approach, to fill the gap between defect prediction data and semantics. In order to automatically extract semantic properties from word vectors generated by program abstract syntax trees (AST) for file-level defect prediction models and source code updates for change-level defect prediction models, we use a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. Two tasks—one for defect prediction at the file level (within-project defect prediction and cross-project defect prediction) and one for defect prediction at the change level (within-project defect prediction and cross-project defect prediction)—were used to assess our methodology. Our findings demonstrate that LSTM-AST-based semantic features can greatly enhance fault identification tasks. The findings demonstrate that the deep learning model LSTM-AST is a practical choice for medium to low sparsity ratio datasets and that, in comparison to other machine models, it performs typically better in high and extremely high sparsity ratio datasets.","","979-8-3503-1341-3","10.1109/EASCT59475.2023.10393261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10393261","Deep Learning (DL);Software defect prediction (SDP);source code;Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM);abstract syntax trees (AST)","Deep learning;Support vector machines;Recurrent neural networks;Source coding;Semantics;Predictive models;Syntactics","","2","","22","IEEE","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transfer learning can be used for transferring knowledge obtained from one domain into the other. In this paper, we propose Transfer Learning Code Vectorizer, a novel method that derives features from the text of the software source code itself and uses those features for defect prediction. We focus on the software code and convert it into vectors using a pre-trained deep learning language model. These code vectors are subsequently passed through machine and deep learning models.

To bridge the gap between semantics and defect prediction features, we propose leveraging a powerful representation-learning algorithm, deep learning, to learn the semantic representations of programs automatically from source code files and code changes. Specifically, we leverage a deep belief network (DBN) to automatically learn semantic features using token vectors extracted from the programs' abstract syntax trees (AST) (for file-level defect prediction models) and source code changes (for change-level defect prediction models). We examine the effectiveness of our approach on two file-level defect prediction tasks (i.e., file-level within-project defect prediction and file-level cross-project defect prediction) and two change-level defect prediction tasks (i.e., change-level within-project defect prediction and change-level cross-project defect prediction). Our experimental results indicate that the DBN-based semantic features can significantly improve the examined defect prediction tasks. Specifically, the improvements of semantic features against existing traditional features (in F1) range from 2.1 to 41.9 percentage points for file-level within-project defect prediction, from 1.5 to 13.4 percentage points for file-level cross-project defect prediction, from 1.0 to 8.6 percentage points for change-level within-project defect prediction, and from 0.6 to 9.9 percentage points for change-level cross-project defect prediction.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2018.2877612","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2018R1C1B6001919); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8502853","Defect prediction;quality assurance;deep learning;semantic features","Semantics;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Quality assurance;Computer bugs;Data models;Prediction models","","238","","111","IEEE","23 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More information such as code comments should be also be embedded to generate semantic features respecting the source code functionality. Therefore, how to embed code comments for defect prediction is a big challenge, and another problem is that many comments of source code are missing in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel defect prediction model named CAP-CNN (Convolutional Neural Network for Comments Augmented Programs), which is a deep learning model that automatically embeds code comments in generating semantic features from the source code for software defect prediction. To overcome the missing comments problem, a novel training strategy is used in CAP-CNN that the network encodes and absorb comments information to generate semantic features automatically during training process, which does not need testing modules to contain comments.

Unfortunately, despite the use of many software quality assurance (SQA) practices in software development (e.g., code review, continuous integration), defects may still exist in the official release of a software product. Therefore, prioritizing SQA efforts for the vulnerable areas of the codebase is essential to ensure the high quality of a software release. Predicting software defects at the line level could help prioritize the SQA effort but is a highly challenging task given that only ≈ 3% lines of a codebase could be defective. Existing works on line-level defect prediction often fall short and cannot fully leverage the line-level defect information. In this paper, we propose - Bugsplorer - a novel deep-learning technique for line-level defect prediction. It leverages a hierarchical structure of transformer models to represent two types of code elements: code tokens and code lines. Unlike the existing techniques that are optimized for file-level defect prediction, Bugsplorer is optimized for a line-level defect prediction objective. Our evaluation with five performance metrics shows that Bugsplorer has a promising capability of predicting defective lines with 26–72% better accuracy than that of the state-of-the-art technique. It can rank the first 20% defective lines within the top 1–3% suspicious lines.

Various features to build defect prediction models have been proposed and evaluated. Among them, process metrics are one important category. Yet, existing process metrics are mainly encoded manually from change histories and ignore the sequential information arising from the changes during software evolution. Are the change sequences derived from such information useful to characterize buggy program modules? How can we leverage such sequences to build good defect prediction models? Unlike traditional process metrics used for existing defect prediction models, change sequences are mostly vectors of variable length. This makes it difficult to apply such sequences directly in prediction models that are driven by conventional classifiers. To resolve this challenge, we utilize Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is a deep learning technique, to encode features from sequence data automatically. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Fences, which extracts six types of change sequences covering different aspects of software changes via fine-grained change analysis. It approaches defects prediction by mapping it to a sequence labeling problem solvable by RNN. Our evaluations on 10 open source projects show that Fences can predict defects with high performance. In particular, our approach achieves an average F-measure of 0.657, which improves the prediction models built on traditional metrics significantly. The improvements vary from 31.6 to 46.8 percent on average. In terms of AUC, Fences achieves an average value of 0.892, and the improvements over baselines vary from 4.2 to 16.1 percent.

However, there exist two main limitations in prior studies: (1) the granularity levels of defect predictions are still coarse-grained and (2) the surrounding tokens and surrounding lines have not yet been fully utilized. In this paper, we perform a survey study to better understand how practitioners perform code inspection in modern code review process, and their perception on a line-level defect prediction. According to the responses from 36 practitioners, we found that 50% of them spent at least 10 minutes to more than one hour to review a single file, while 64% of them still perceived that code inspection activity is challenging to extremely challenging. In addition, 64% of the respondents perceived that a line-level defect prediction tool would potentially be helpful in identifying defective lines. Motivated by the practitioners’ perspective, we present DeepLineDP, a deep learning approach to automatically learn the semantic properties of the surrounding tokens and lines in order to identify defective files and defective lines. Through a case study of 32 releases of 9 software projects, we find that the risk score of code tokens varies greatly depending on their location. Our DeepLineDP is 17%-37% more accurate than other file-level defect prediction approaches; is 47%-250% more cost-effective than other line-level defect prediction approaches; and achieves a reasonable performance when transferred to other software projects.

Secondly, a small set of valuable uncertainty samples is selected from the unlabeled sample pool using data-driven active deep learning and provided to Oracle for annotation, and then the annotated samples are added to the labeled sample pool. Lastly, a low-cost data annotation model is constructed based on the labeled sample pool and employed for cross-project just-in-time software defect prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the performance of the cross-project just-in-time software defect prediction model.","2693-9371","979-8-3503-5939-8","10.1109/QRS-C60940.2023.00073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10430009","Crass-project just-in-time software defect prediction;Deep learning;Active learning;Data-driven","Deep learning;Uncertainty;Annotations;Predictive models;Software;Data models;Labeling","","1","","27","IEEE","19 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These methodologies, however, had lower accuracy in determining SQPMs due to their inability to model the complex relationships in the training data. With the wide emergence of deep learning, not only has the accuracy of the pre-existing models enhanced, but it has also opened doors for new metrics that could be evaluated and automated. This study performs a systematic literature review of research papers published from January 1990 to January 2019 that used deep learning to evaluate software quality prediction metrics (SQPM). The paper identifies 20 primary studies and 7 categories of application of deep learning in SQPM. Models using deep learning techniques significantly outperform other traditional methodologies in almost all studies. The concept and external threats to the models are limited, however the time taken to train these models is large. The techniques, currently predominantly applied for defect prediction, have shown promising results in other diverse software engineering fields like code search and effort estimation by modeling the source code efficiently. There is, hence, scope for incorporating deep learning further with pragmatic use and diverse application.

Implementing defect prediction can assist quality assurance teams in identifying potential software issues and rationalizing the allocation of testing resources, thereby decreasing the elimination of resources and enhancing software sustainability. Researchers have recently incorporated deep learning into defect prediction, extracting structural-semantic features from codes’ abstract syntax trees (ASTs). However, inappropriate node granularity in ASTs may adversely impact the effectiveness of the extracted features. In addition, converting AST nodes into integer vectors may lead to the loss of structure information, resulting in poor model predictive capability. This paper proposes a tree-based encoding method with hybrid granularity for defect prediction to address these challenges. Specifically, five granularity selection schemes are extended to generate various ASTs from codes.

Even though different techniques have been proposed for defect localization, i.e., information retrieval (IR)-based techniques and spectrum-based techniques, they can only work after the defect has been exposed, which can be too late and costly to adapt to the newly introduced bugs in the daily development. There are also many JIT defect prediction tools that have been proposed to predict the buggy commit. But these tools do not locate the suspicious buggy positions in the buggy commit. To assist developers to detect bugs in time and avoid introducing them, just-in-time (JIT) bug localization techniques have been proposed, which is targeting to locate suspicious buggy code after a change commit has been submitted. In this paper, we propose a novel JIT defect localization approach, named DeepDL (Deep Learning-based defect localization), to locate defect code lines within a defect introducing change. DeepDL employs a neural language model to capture the semantics of the code lines, in this way, the naturalness of each code line can be learned and converted to a suspiciousness score. The core of our DeepDL is a deep learning-based neural language model. We train the neural language model with previous snapshots (history versions) of a project so that it can calculate the naturalness of a piece of code. In its application, for a given new code change, DeepDL automatically assigns a suspiciousness score to each code line and sorts these code lines in descending order of this score. The code lines at the top of the list are considered as potential defect locations. Our tool can assist developers efficiently check buggy lines at an early stage, which is able to reduce the risk of introducing bugs in time and improve the developers’ confidence in the reliability of their software. We conducted an extensive experiment on 14 open source Java projects with a total of 11,615 buggy changes. We evaluate the experimental results considering four evaluation metrics.

Another limitation is that the amount of training data may be too small for machine learning, and it is extremely difficult to handle class imbalance and dataset expansion. In this study, we propose a method called spatial pyramid pooling for defect prediction (SPP-DP) that first converts all the source files into images, each of which will generate multiple images with different lengths and widths, to address the limitations of class imbalance handling and data augmentation. Second, we input these images into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to build a classifier to predict software defects. We added a spatial pyramid pooling layer (SPP-Layer) architecture to the CNN to relax the limitation of the fixed input size.

As technology meets iron through smart machines, there is increased embedded software within products. To provide distinctive customer experience for a solution system, along with reliability of hardware, development of reliable software also plays a critical role. This paper proposes models in which software reliability is a function of the number of residual faults and is measured with the help of software metrics based on development data. The intent is to establish a statistical relationship between product metrics (that deal with the measurement of the software product) or process metrics (the process by which it is developed) with measures of quality. Using both a pattern recognition algorithm approach for classifying fault proneness and applying fuzzy logic to software metrics for defect prediction is found to be beneficial for improving software reliability prediction in early development phases.

Consequently, many researchers have employed deep learning models to capture contextual, semantic, and structural information from the code. In this article, we propose the DP-CCL (Defect Prediction using CodeBERT with Contrastive Learning) model to predict the defective code. The proposed model employs supervised contrastive learning using this CodeBERT Language model to capture semantic features from the source code. Contrastive learning extracts valuable information from the data by maximizing the similarity between similar data pairs (positive pair) and meanwhile minimizing the similarity between dissimilar data pairs (negative pair). Moreover, The model combines the semantic features with software metrics to obtain the benefits of both semantic and handcrafted features. The combined features are input to the logistic regression model for code classification as either buggy or clean. In this study, ten PROMISE projects were utilized to conduct the experiments.

A benchmark is used on a dataset of software metrics, consisting of categorical and numerical features with software metrics, to train and test these models. In earlier works, the aim was to predict the presence of software defects using accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall for evaluation criteria. Gradient Boosting and LGBM Classifier achieved accuracies of 81.48% and 81.46%, respectively, with the results indicating that these models are better performers in predicting software faults. A model was evaluated using the Power Rule-enabled Voting Ensemble, which combines the strengths of multiple models and maintains a competitive accuracy of 81.38%. However, the lower recall across all classifiers suggests room for improvement in recall-oriented metrics, especially when aiming to identify a higher number of real defects. Moreover, it highlights the significant impact of feature engineering and class imbalances, as these factors largely influence the true positive results in fault detection across the models. Although the accuracy and precision are relatively strong, the F1 scores reveal that balancing recall and precision remains a challenge. Enhancing the models' ability to detect more actual software faults is a key objective for real-world applications.

To be fed into the neural network, the sample codes are represented as an abstract syntax tree (AST), and the AST is encoded as real numbers. However, in most cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) task, the method for converting the AST into a real number cannot effectively estimate the semantic distance between the ASTs, resulting in a significant reduction in training effects. To solve that problem, we present a new encoding framework, tree-based-embedding (TBE), to convert AST into real vectors and make the semantic gap between the ASTs measurable. To estimate the effect of this encoding method, we promise a tree-based-embedding convolutional neural network with transferable hybrid feature learning (TBCNN-THFL) to perform the CPDP tasks.

Most of the previous work tried to utilize the labeled dataset gathered from other projects (i.e., the source projects) and then proposed transfer learning based methods to reduce the data distribution difference between different projects. In this article, we propose a deep learning based CPDP method DeepCPDP. For this method, we represent source code of each extracted program module by using simplified abstract syntax tree (SimAST). For a node of SimAST, we only keep its node type, since this is project-independent, while we ignore the name of method and variable, since these information are project-specific. Therefore, SimAST is project-independent and especially suitable for the task of CPDP. Then, we extract the token vector from each module after it is modeled via SimAST. Moreover, we design a new unsupervised based embedding method SimASTToken2Vec to learn meaningful representation for these extracted token vectors. Later, we employ Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network to automatically learn semantic features from embedded token vectors. In addition, we use attention mechanism over the BiLSTM layer to learn the weight of the vectors from the learned semantic features. Finally, we construct CPDP models via Logistic regression classifier. To show the effectiveness of DeepCPDP, ten large-scale projects from different application domains are used and AUC measure is used to measure the prediction performance of trained models. By using Scott-Knott test, we can find DeepCPDP can significantly outperform eight state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we also verify that the usage of SimASTToken2Vec, BiLSTM and attention mechanism is competitive in our proposed method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2961129","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702041,61872263,61202006); Nantong Application Research Plan(grant numbers:JC2018134,JC2019106); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8937501","Software defect prediction;cross-project defect prediction;bi-directional long short-term memory;embedding method;attention mechanism","Software;Semantics;Feature extraction;Measurement;Deep learning;Predictive models;Syntactics","","38","","64","CCBY","20 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent CPDP approaches have employed deep learning techniques to better exploit the information from the program's abstract syntax trees (ASTs). However, the granularity of the AST nodes and the data distribution difference between projects may have negative impacts on the prediction performance, which many CPDP studies didn't take into consideration. To handle these issues, this paper explores a better AST node granularity and proposes a CPDP framework based on multi-kernel transfer convolutional neural networks. Specifically, for AST node granularity, we explore the difference of three AST node granularities and then compare the prediction performance of each granularity on several prediction models. For the CPDP framework, we first parse the program source code into ASTs and then encode the AST nodes into numerical vectors using the embedding technique. Secondly, to mine transferable semantic features, the encoded ASTs are fed into a convolutional neural network, in which a multi-kernel matching layer is added to minimize the data distribution divergence between the source and target project. Finally, to make use of the information from the handcrafted features, the semantic features mined from the AST are joint with handcrafted features to form the joint features for CPDP. We evaluate our approach on 110 CPDP tasks formed by 11 open-source projects and results show that the proposed CPDP method outperforms most deep learning-based approaches.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2985780","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61370103); Guangzhou Produce Research Fund(grant numbers:201902020004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057380","Abstract syntax tree;cross-project defect prediction;maximum mean discrepancy;multi-kernel;transfer learning","Feature extraction;Semantics;Software;Task analysis;Machine learning;Convolutional neural networks;Syntactics","","21","","48","CCBY","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, researchers utilized deep learning models to extract semantic features from abstract syntax tree (AST) of source code which showed a better prediction performance over metric-based methods. However, the existing file-level SDP models representing the AST as a flattened sequence could jeopardize the preservation of long-term dependency. In this paper, we propose a new Defect Prediction framework based on the Hierarchical Neural Network (DP-HNN). Our method makes use of the hierarchical structure of AST by splitting the large file-level AST into several subtrees according to certain AST nodes crucial to SDP task. These subtrees represented by node-level sequences are encoded separately and then serve as the elements of the subtree-level sequence. Finally, a multi-granularity fusion approach is performed in the subtree-level encoder to obtain the crucial features that represent the code file. Our proposed DP-HNN is aimed at capturing long-term dependency while preserving fine-grained local information. We conducted experiments on 11 open-source projects considering the cross-version and the mixed-version scenario of within-project SDP. Results show that on average, DP-HNN improves the state-of-the-art method by 14% and 3% on MCC and AUC scores respectively.","0730-3157","978-1-6654-2463-9","10.1109/COMPSAC51774.2021.00059","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9529567","software defect prediction;abstract syntax tree;hierarchical neural network","Codes;Neural networks;Semantics;Syntactics;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Software reliability","","5","","43","IEEE","9 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The severity assigned to the bug report is conducted manually. So, it takes some considerable time to assign the severity manually, and also it is a tedious task. In this research, we used a deep learning-based technique to develop the prediction model for severity.

This article presents an approach for finding vulnerabilities at the line-of-code level using perturbation-based explainability methods.

A bug is an error or defect in a computer program that prevents it from functioning as intended. Bug prioritization is the process of determining which bugs should be fixed first. Prioritizing bugs is essential because it helps teams focus their efforts on fixing the most critical issues first. In recent years, the majority of researchers have focused their efforts on software bug priority-level prediction since currently it has been done manually. It is a time-consuming work and the accuracy level is also low. Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to propose an approach for predicting the bug priority level using deep learning algorithms. We used the Bugzilla dataset, which included more than 25,000 bug reports. After preprocessing data, we used several feature extraction methods, such as Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe), Word to Vector (Word2Vec), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Document to Vector (Doc2Vec) methods to extract the features. There are four convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including AlexNet, 1DCNN, ResNet, and DenseNet used to compare the best architecture for predicting the bug priority. The accuracy is provided by each separate model: AlexNet 88.62%, 1DCNN 77.81%, ResNet 76.33%, and DenseNet 96.69%. This evaluation result discovered that DenseNet outperformed other CNN architectures in accuracy, precision, f-measure, recall, and error values.

Existing methods often serialize an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) obtained from the program source code into a token sequence, which is then inputted into the deep learning model to learn the semantic features. However, there are different ASTs with the same token sequence, and it is impossible to distinguish the tree structure of the ASTs only by a token sequence. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a framework called Semantic Feature Learning via Dual Sequences (SFLDS), which can capture the semantic and structural information in the AST for feature generation. Specifically, based on the AST, we select the representative nodes in the AST and convert the program source code into a simplified AST (S-AST). Our method introduces two sequences to represent the semantic and structural information of the S-AST, one is the result of traversing the S-AST node in pre-order, and another is composed of parent nodes. Then each token in the dual sequences is encoded as a numerical vector via mapping and word embedding. Finally, we use a bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) based neural network to automatically generate semantic features from the dual sequences for SDP. In addition, to leverage the statistical characteristics contained in the handcrafted metrics, we also propose a framework called Defect Prediction via SFLDS (DP-SFLDS) which combines the semantic features generated from SFLDS with handcrafted metrics to perform SDP. In our empirical studies, eight open-source Java projects from the PROMISE repository are chosen as our empirical subjects.

The traditional manual inspection method has the problems of low efficiency, high labor and material consumption and low safety, so the country is vigorously developing the drone industry at this stage. UAV inspection tasks are becoming more and more important, and it has become a trend for UAVs to shift to the direction of unmanned operations. With the increase of UAV density in large cities, it is meaningful to control and manage the trajectory of UAVs and provide intelligent trajectory optimization and anti-collision system. In order to achieve safe and fast autonomous flight, it is necessary to intelligently optimize the flight trajectory of UAV to ensure the best response time and increase the duration of continuous flight. At the same time, due to the low-slow-small characteristics of UAVs and the complexity of cities, UAVs are often faced with the interference of airborne obstacles, such as utility poles or flying birds, and need to perform real-time environment sensing and change their trajectories in time to avoid these obstacles. We propose an ED-YOLO network model for target detection of UAV obstacles. The target detection algorithm is based on YOLOv4, and firstly, a channel attention mechanism is added to the backbone network to improve the detection accuracy without increasing the computation. Compared with YOLOv4, its average accuracy mean of obstacle target detection is only reduced by 1.4%, while the model volume is reduced by 94.9%, the floating-point operation volume is reduced by 82.1%, and the prediction speed is improved by 2.3 times.

Based on an exploratory study on clone change propagation with five famous open-source projects, we find that a clone class can have both propagation-required changes and propagation-free changes and thus fine-grained change propagation decision is required. Based on the findings, we propose a graph-based deep learning approach to predict the change propagation requirements of clone instances. We develop a graph representation, named Fused Clone Program Dependency Graph (FC-PDG), to capture the textual and structural code contexts of a pair of clone instances along with the changes on one of them. Based on the representation, we design a deep learning model that uses a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) to predict the change propagation requirement. We evaluate the approach with a dataset constructed based on 51 open-source Java projects, which includes 24,672 pairs of matched changes and 38,041 non-matched changes. The results show that the approach achieves high precision (83.1%), recall (81.2%), and F1-score (82.1%). Our further evaluation with three other open-source projects confirms the generality of the trained clone change propagation prediction model.","2643-7171","978-1-4503-9298-3","10.1145/3524610.3527766","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172099); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796242","code clone;change propagation;clone consistency;dataset","Deep learning;Convolutional codes;Java;Codes;Cloning;Predictive models;Maintenance engineering","","2","","48","","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As interest in edge-cloud systems grows, research on testing the systems has also been actively studied. However, as with traditional systems, the amount of resources for testing is always limited. Thus, we suggest a function-level just-in-time (JIT) software defect prediction (SDP) model based on a pre-trained model to address the limitation by prioritizing the limited testing resources for the defect-prone functions. The pre-trained model is a transformer-based deep learning model trained on a large corpus of code snippets, and the fine-tuned pre-trained model can provide the defect proneness for the changed functions at a commit level. We evaluate the performance of the three popular pre-trained models (i.e., CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UniXCoder) on edge-cloud systems in within-project and cross-project environments. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to analyse the performance of the three pre-trained model-based SDP models for edge-cloud systems. As a result, we can confirm that UniXCoder showed the best performance among the three in the WPDP environment. However, we also confirm that additional research is necessary to apply the SDP models to the CPDP environment.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2223","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2020R1F1A1071888,NRF-2022R1I1A3069233); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10247502","Just-in-time defect prediction;pre-trained model;edge-cloud system","Performance evaluation;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Memory;Predictive models;Transformers;Software quality;Edge computing;Cloud computing","","2","","30","","22 Sep 2023","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

This is generally carried out by human operators that are not able to inspect all the packages due to cadence restrictions. To overcome this limitation, a computer vision system that automatically performs 100% inline seal and closure inspection is proposed. In this paper, after evaluating pizza package features, the manual quality control procedure, and the packaging machines of a real industrial scenario, a detailed description of hardware and software components of the proposed system as well as the main design decisions are presented. Focusing on the hardware, line-scan technology and hyperspectral imaging has been considered to ensure that all relevant information can be acquired independently of the pizza brand, topping, and film features. Focusing on the software, this applies a three-phases strategy that, first, applies a set of basic rejection controls; second, identifies the sealing region; and third, prepares the data for prediction through the classification of the pizzas using a deep learning network. This network is one of the software key elements and has been selected after comparing the commercial off-the-shelf (pretrained-dl-classifier-resnet50 from MVTec Halcon) and the custom-developed (ResNet18) architectures designed to automate the accept/reject classification of pizza packages. To train the networks, a classification of pizza package defects, focusing on sealing and closure, and an image-based method able to automatically detect them have been proposed. The system has been tested in laboratory and in real industrial conditions comparing it with the manual scenario and considering three pizza brands with two toppings per brand. From the evaluation, it has been seen that ResNet18 achieves the best results with mean, maximum, and minimum precision values of 99.87%, 99.95%, and 99.74%, respectively. Moreover, our system achieves twice the throughput rate with respect to the manual scenario, with the guarantee that all pizzas are evaluated, which is not possible in the manual scenario due to operator fatigue. The proposed solution can be easily adapted to similar contexts, even considering packages with other shapes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3135973","Doctorate Industrial Program through the Catalan Government (2018–2021)(grant numbers:2018DI026); Catalan Government(grant numbers:2017-SGR-1101); Spanish Government(grant numbers:MICIUPID2019-106426RB-C31); Chinese Academy of Sciences President’s International Fellowship Initiative(grant numbers:2021VTB0004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9652515","Convolutional neural networks;artificial intelligence classifier;machine vision;food processing industry;image processing;industry automation;pizza packaging;seal inspection","Feature extraction;Quality control;Seals;Inspection;Computer vision;Focusing;Convolutional neural networks","","16","","62","CCBYNCND","15 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the models proposed in previous studies may demonstrate satisfactory performance on benchmark datasets, translating academic findings into practical applications for industry practitioners presents challenges. This can entail either the direct adoption of trained academic models into industrial applications, leading to a performance decrease, or retraining models with industrial data, a task often hindered by insufficient data instances or skewed data distributions. Real-world industrial data is typically significantly more intricate than benchmark datasets, frequently exhibiting data-skewing issues, such as label distribution skews and quantity skews. Furthermore, accessing industrial data, particularly source code, can prove challenging for Software Engineering (SE) researchers due to privacy policies. This limitation hinders SE researchers’ ability to gain insights into industry developers’ concerns and subsequently enhance their proposed models. To bridge the divide between academic models and industrial applications, we introduce a federated learning (FL)-based framework called Almity. Our aim is to simplify the process of implementing research findings into practical use for both SE researchers and industry developers. Almity enhances model performance on sensitive skewed data distributions while ensuring data privacy and security. It introduces an innovative aggregation strategy that takes into account three key attributes: data scale, data balance, and minority class learnability. This strategy is employed to refine model parameters, thereby enhancing model performance on sensitive skewed datasets. In our evaluation, we employ two well-established SE tasks, i.e., code clone detection and defect prediction, as evaluation tasks. We compare the performance of Almity on both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models against two mainstream training methods, specifically the Centralized Training Method (CTM) and Vanilla Federated Learning (VFL), to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of Almity. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework is not only feasible but also practical in real-world scenarios. Almity consistently enhances the performance of learning-based models, outperforming baseline training methods across all types of data distributions.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2023.3347898","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62141222); National Research Foundation(grant numbers:NRF-NRFI08-2022-0002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10379838","Federated learning;parameter aggregation strategy;skewed data distribution;code clone detection;defect prediction","Data models;Training;Codes;Cloning;Task analysis;Benchmark testing;Industries","","9","","85","IEEE","3 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The traditional approaches to defect prediction have predominantly relied on manually engineered features, which often limit the ability to capture intricate semantic relationships within the code. This limitation becomes particularly evident when applying these methods to complex software systems that exhibit high-dimensional and imbalanced data characteristics. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative defect prediction model leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful deep learning technique. The proposed CNN-based model automatically extracts deep features from multi-dimensional data sources such as commit records, development logs, and other development-related metadata. By utilizing the CNN model, the system can learn hierarchical patterns within the data that are often indicative of software defects. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the CNN-based model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF), in terms of prediction accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Specifically, the model excels in addressing the issue of class imbalance, which is a common challenge in defect prediction tasks, especially in large-scale software systems where defect samples are sparse. Moreover, the CNN-based model shows robustness in handling large and complex datasets, making it an effective tool for defect prediction in industrial-scale software development environments. This research contributes a novel perspective to the field of software defect prediction by integrating deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, into the software engineering domain. By automatically extracting relevant features from raw data, the model enhances prediction accuracy and offers an effective solution for quality assurance in large-scale software projects. The findings of this study provide substantial technical support for improving software quality and reducing maintenance costs, thereby contributing to more efficient and reliable software development practices.","","979-8-3503-9234-0","10.1109/MLISE66443.2025.11100144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11100144","Software defect prediction;Convolutional Neural Networks;Deep learning;Data imbalance;Software quality assurance","Deep learning;Support vector machines;Software quality;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Software systems;Software;Convolutional neural networks;Software engineering;Software development management","","","","9","IEEE","7 Aug 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, AST-based neural network models might overlook important structural information related to control flows embedded within the source code. Given that software defects are often influenced by control flow patterns, this article proposes a novel SDP approach called control flow graph and graph attention (CFG2AT) network-based SDP. CFG2AT is specifically designed to automatically identify software defects and contains a graph-structured attention unit to effectively capture control flow information.

Most previous studies primarily constructed defect prediction models using traditional metric-based features. However, in recent years, research focusing on semantic feature-based defect prediction has gained increasing attention, with researchers leveraging deep learning to automatically extract deep semantic information from source code. Nevertheless, existing approaches often rely on a single type of source code representation, overlooking the advantages and potential contributions of diverse features. To address this issue, this paper proposes a software defect prediction method based on multi-feature fusion, which incorporates multiple types of code representations to capture semantic information from different perspectives.

LIME, which relies on local perturbation strategies, is prone to data structure distortion in high-dimensional sparse data, leading to distribution shifts that reduce the stability of explanations. Similarly, the ANCHOR method, which extracts decision rules through greedy search, often generates complex and unintuitive rules, impairing readability. Moreover, these methods fail to effectively capture complex nonlinear feature interactions present in software code change data, resulting in insufficient explanation accuracy and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, this chapter proposes a software defect prediction model explainability approach based on the Dynamic Attention Rule (DynAR).

To improve system quality and reduce costs, it is necessary to predict software defects in the early stages of the software development lifecycle. This paper proposes Double Fault Disagreement (DFD), a novel diversity metric and method for selecting competent base classifiers for ensemble learning-based software defect prediction. To consider the diversity features of the base learners, several base learners with strong diversity are chosen to build ensemble learning. This method makes full use of the diversity characteristics of base learners, leverages their classification ability, optimizes the selection method for ensemble learning, and enhances the predictive performance of the ensemble model. The experimental results demonstrate that the DFD ensemble learning-based software defect prediction model outperforms the ten other models, including five common machine learning (ML) classification algorithms (logistic regression (LR), naïve Bayes (NB), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and support vector machine (SVM)), two deep learning (DL) algorithms (multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN)), and three ensemble learning algorithms (random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and stacking). The DFD model achieves superior performance on eight public NASA and PROMISE datasets (six of which are imbalanced) across five performance indicators, including area under the curve (AUC), geometric mean (G-Mean), F1 score, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and Balance. Furthermore, the DFD method is not only highly performant but also requires a small number of base learners to converge rapidly, thereby reducing the amount of data and computation time required.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3537658","China Scholarship Council and Sichuan Provincial Department of Education’s Western Program Local Innovation Sub-Project(grant numbers:202008510173); UAV Industry Development Research Center of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:SCUAV22-B002,SCUAV22-C005); Key Project of Chengdu Technological University(grant numbers:2024ZR007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10869442","Diversity measures;double fault disagreement;ensemble classifier selection;imbalanced data classification;software defect prediction","Ensemble learning;Predictive models;Measurement;Computational modeling;Classification algorithms;Software;Volume measurement;Weight measurement;Stacking;Prediction algorithms","","1","","66","CCBYNCND","3 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to minimize the harm caused by software defects, it is necessary to predict software defects at the early stage of development. Existing traditional software defect prediction often consists of manual features, ignoring the semantic features of the source code. Deep learning uses AST to obtain the semantic relationship of the source code, which often fails to capture the deep semantic information due to its limitation. In recent studies, pre-trained models can understand the syntax and semantics of the code as well as the logical relationship between the codes by learning a large amount of corpus data through self-supervised learning. Based on this, we use three pre-trained models to extract the semantic features of the source code, meanwhile, we use the gated network mechanism to effectively integrate the traditional features, and propose the Gated Hierarchical LLM(GH_LLM), which proves that the traditional features and the semantic features of the source code are complementary to each other. Afterwards, in the PROMISE dataset, by comparing with the existing baseline model for extracting semantic features, the relevant metrics are improved, and the experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2693-9371","978-1-6654-7773-4","10.1109/QRS-C65679.2025.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11216514","Pre-trained model;Semantic features;Gated network;Software defect prediction","Deep learning;Codes;Source coding;Semantics;Logic gates;Predictive models;Syntactics;Feature extraction;Software;Software reliability","","","","28","IEEE","31 Oct 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we propose a Deep Learning (DL)-based approach that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with semantic feature extraction to improve the effectiveness of defect prediction. Our method utilizes representations derived from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to capture structural and contextual information from the code. To address the challenge of class imbalance—common in SDP datasets—we apply the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and cost-sensitive learning, enhancing the model’s sensitivity to defective code components. Experiments on the PROMISE dataset, covering multiple versions of Java projects, show that our approach significantly outperforms models based solely on static metrics. Comparative analysis with recent studies further highlights the strengths of our method in capturing long-range code dependencies and improving defect detection accuracy. These results support the potential of integrating LSTM-based semantic modeling and class imbalance handling to advance the state of SDP.","2644-1268","","10.1109/OJCS.2025.3613134","NOVA Laboratory for Computer Science and Informatics; FCT.IP(grant numbers:UIDB/04516/2020); COMPETE2030 Program through the Horus 360 iOMS NextGen Project; Hidropon.IA Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11175486","Defect prediction in software engineering;imbalanced learning in software engineering;source code analysis;LSTM in software analytics;AI for software engineering (AI4SE)","Codes;Semantics;Long short term memory;Software;Predictive models;Source coding;Computational modeling;Accuracy;Feature extraction;Software engineering","","","","26","CCBY","22 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deep learning has advanced SDP by improving accuracy. However, its lack of interpretability remains a critical limitation. Although some existing methods offer explanations for SDP models, they typically focus on assigning feature importance within model decisions. However, these explanations often remain superficial, failing to clarify the specific roles that features play in the decision-making process. To address these challenges, this article presents counterfactual contrastive explanations for SDP (CCE-SDP), a novel framework that generates counterfactual contrastive explanations to enhance model transparency. Leveraging genetic algorithms, CCE-SDP constructs optimal counterfactual examples to reveal how specific changes in software metrics influence predictions, offering fine-grained, instance-level insights. The core of the CCE-SDP method is to offer counterfactual explanations that minimize the number of altered features while maximizing the counterfactual trust score. In addition, by incorporating synthetic counterfactual samples with defect labels into the training process, the ability to handle imbalanced data is also enhanced. Experiments on 36 benchmark software projects showed that the CCE-SDP model demonstrated to users how specific feature changes impact predictive outcomes, thereby allowing for a better understanding of the model’s decision-making. Furthermore, by embedding counterfactual analysis within the model training, we successfully boosted the predictive performance of the SDP models.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2025.3611079","Guangdong Provincial Junior Innovative Talents Project for Regular Universities(grant numbers:2023KQNCX005); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2024M750935,2025T180948); Guangdong Philosophy and Social Science Foundation Regular Project(grant numbers:GD24YXW02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11185246","Counterfactual generation;counterfactual trust score (CTS);interpretable machine learning;software defect prediction (SDP)","Predictive models;Software;Decision making;Accuracy;Deep learning;Training;Costs;Prediction algorithms;Maintenance;Computational modeling","","","","","IEEE","1 Oct 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, their long time execution and unstable results raise challenges for performance testing. Recent studies have attempted to predict code execution times using deep learning, but these methods often fail to consider the specifics of microbenchmarks, especially in terms of performance variability. This paper proposes a method called JMH-Prophet which combines static code features of microbenchmarks, including parameter information, augmented abstract syntax trees, and augmented control flow graphs, to accurately predict the execution time for microbenchmarks. Experiments show that JMH-Prophet outperforms state-of-the-art, specially, in the stable phase, the Pearson correlation coefficient improved by 182%, and the mean square error was reduced by 56.3%.
