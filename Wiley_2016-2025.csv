Recently, GLANCE was proposed as a readily implementable baseline for assessing the efficacy of newly proposed LL-SDP models. Problem While DeepLineDP, a cutting-edge LL-SDP model rooted in deep learning, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, it has not yet been compared against GLANCE. Objective We aim to empirically compare DeepLineDP with GLANCE to obtain a comprehensive understanding of how deep learning contributes to solving the LL-SDP challenge. Method We compare GLANCE against DeepLineDP to assess the extent to which DeepLineDP surpasses GLANCE in predicting defective files and identifying problematic lines. In order to obtain a reliable conclusion, we use the same dataset and performance metrics utilized by DeepLineDP. Result Our experimental findings indicate that DeepLineDP does not outperform GLANCE in LL-SDP. This suggests that the application of deep learning, in this context, does not yield the anticipated significant improvements. Conclusion This finding underscores the need for further research in deep learning-based LL-SDP to attain the state-of-the-art performance that remains elusive for less advanced techniques.","code features, deep learning, defect prediction, line-level","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smr.2696",""

Existing software defect prediction models are usually based on machine learning methods, especially deep learning. Deep learning-based methods tend to build end-to-end models that directly use source code-based abstract syntax trees (ASTs) as input. They do not pay enough attention to the front-end data representation. In this paper, we propose a new framework to represent source code called multiperspective tree embedding (MPT-embedding), which is an unsupervised representation learning method. MPT-embedding parses the nodes of ASTs from multiple perspectives and encodes the structural information of a tree into a vector sequence. Experiments on both cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) and within-project defect prediction (WPDP) show that, on average, MPT-embedding provides improvements over the state-of-the-art method.","deep learning, defect prediction, representation learning, tree embedding","e2330 smr.2330","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smr.2330",""

Nevertheless, the complex internal intrinsic structure hidden behind the defect data makes it challenging for the built prediction model to capture the most expressive defect feature representations, and largely limits the SDP performance. Fortunately, artificial intelligence is interacting closely with humans and provides powerful intelligent technical support for addressing these SDP issues. In this article, we propose a robust intelligent SDP model called IMDAC based on deep learning and soft computing techniques. This model has three main advantages: (1) an effective deep generative network—InfoGAN (information maximizing GANs) is employed to conduct data augmentation, namely generating sufficient defect instances and achieving defect class balance simultaneously. (2) Select the fewest representative feature subset for the minimum error via an advanced multi-objective optimization approach—MSEA (multi-stage evolutionary algorithm). (3) Build a powerful end-to-end deep defect predictor by hybrid deep learning techniques—DAE (Denoising AutoEncoder) and CNN (convolutional neural network), which can not only reconstruct a clean “repaired” input with strong robustness and generalization capabilities via DAE, but also learn the abstract deep semantic features with strong discriminating capability via CNN. Experimental results verify the superiority and robustness of the IMDAC model across 15 software projects.","convolutional neural network, deep learning, denoising autoencoder, multi-objective optimization, software defect prediction","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/spe.3274",""

Cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) is introduced for the anticipation of defects in novel projects lacking defect labels. CPDP can use defect information of mature projects to speed up defect prediction for new projects. So that developers can quickly get the defect information of the new project, so that they can test the software project pertinently. At present, the predominant approaches in CPDP rely on deep learning, and the performance of the ultimate model is notably affected by the quality of the training dataset. However, the dataset of CPDP not only has few samples but also has almost no label information in new projects, which makes the general deep-learning-based CPDP model not ideal. In addition, most of the current CPDP models do not fully consider the enrichment of classification boundary samples after cross-domain, leading to suboptimal predictive capabilities of the model. To overcome these obstacles, we present contrastive learning pretraining for CPDP (ConCPDP), a CPDP method integrating contrastive pretraining and category boundary adjustment. We first perform data augmentation on the source and target domain code files and then extract the enhanced data as an abstract syntax tree (AST). The AST is then transformed into an integer sequence using specific mapping rules, serving as input for the subsequent neural network. A neural network based on bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) will receive an integer sequence and output a feature vector. Then, the feature vectors are input into the contrastive module to optimise the feature extraction network. The pretrained feature extractor can be fine-tuned by the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between the feature distribution of the source domain and the target domain and the binary classification loss on the source domain. This paper conducts a large number of experiments on the PROMISE dataset, which is commonly used for CPDP, to validate ConCPDP’s efficacy, achieving superior results in terms of F1 measure, area under curve (AUC), and Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC).","","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1049/2024/5102699",""

To solve these problems, the authors propose a model based on multi-adaptation and nuclear norm (MANN) to deal with samples in projects. The feature of samples were embedded into the multi-core Hilbert space for distribution and the multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy method was utilised to reduce differences among projects. More importantly, the nuclear norm module was constructed, which improved the discriminability and diversity of the target sample by calculating and maximizing the nuclear norm of the target sample in the process of domain adaptation, thus improving the performance of MANN.

This characteristic can introduce defects into the software. To provide immediate feedback to developers, previous researchers began to focus on just-in-time (JIT) software defect prediction techniques. JIT defect prediction aims to determine whether code commits will introduce defects into the software. It contains two scenarios, within-project JIT defect prediction and cross-project JIT defect prediction. Regardless of whether within-project JIT defect prediction or cross-project JIT defect prediction all need to have enough labeled data (within-project JIT defect prediction assumes that have plenty of labeled data from the same project, while cross-project JIT defect prediction assumes that have sufficient labeled data from source projects). However, in practice, both the source and target projects may only have limited labeled data. We propose the MTL-DNN method based on multi-task learning to solve this question. This method contains the data preprocessing layer, input layer, shared layers, task-specific layers, and output layer. Where the common features of multiple related tasks are learned by sharing layers, and the unique features of each task are learned by the task-specific layers. For verifying the effectiveness of the MTL-DNN approach, we evaluate our method on 15 Android mobile apps. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art single-task deep learning and classical machine learning methods. This result shows that the MTL-DNN method can effectively solve the problem of insufficient labeled training data for source and target projects.","Android applications, deep learning, just-in-time, mobile apps, multi-task learning, software defect prediction","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cpe.7664",""

However, the research objects are mainly limited to coarse-grained entities such as classes, files, and packages, and there is a wide range of defects that are difficult to predict in actual situations.

We embedded the token sequence into the method-call sequence and encoded it into a fixed-length real-valued vector. We then built a defect-prediction model based on the transformer, which maps the code-vector representation containing the method-call sequences to a low-dimensional vector space to generate semantic features and syntactic structure features and also predicts the defect density of the method-call sequence.

A cost penalty term is added to the supervised part of the deep ladder network; that is, the misclassification cost of different classes is added to the model. A cost-sensitive deep ladder network-based software defect prediction model is proposed, which effectively mitigates the negative impact of the class imbalance problem on defect prediction. To address the problem of lack or insufficiency of historical data from the same project, a flow learning-based geodesic cross-project software defect prediction method is proposed. Drawing on data information from other projects, a migration learning approach was used to embed the source and target datasets into a Gaussian manifold. The kernel encapsulates the incremental changes between the differences and commonalities between the two domains. To this point, the subspace is the space of two distributional approximations formed by the source and target data transformations, with traditional in-project software defect classifiers used to predict labels. It is found that real-time defect prediction is more practical because it has a smaller amount of code to review; only individual changes need to be reviewed rather than entire files or packages while making it easier for developers to assign fixes to defects. More importantly, this paper combines deep belief network techniques with real-time defect prediction at a fine-grained level and TCA techniques to deal with data imbalance and proposes an improved deep belief network approach for real-time defect prediction, while trying to change the machine learning classifier underlying DBN for different experimental studies, and the results not only validate the effectiveness of using TCA techniques to solve the data imbalance problem but also show that the defect prediction model learned by the improved method in this paper has better prediction performance.","","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1155/2021/2323100",""

The classic CPDP methods mainly concentrated on applying metric features to predict defects. However, these approaches failed to consider the rich semantic information, which usually contains the relationship between software defects and context. Since traditional methods are unable to exploit this characteristic, their performance is often unsatisfactory. In this paper, a transfer long short-term memory (TLSTM) network model is first proposed. Transfer semantic features are extracted by adding a transfer learning algorithm to the long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Then, the traditional metric features and semantic features are combined for CPDP. First, the abstract syntax trees (AST) are generated based on the source codes. Second, the AST node contents are converted into integer vectors as inputs to the TLSTM model. Then, the semantic features of the program can be extracted by TLSTM. On the other hand, transferable metric features are extracted by transfer component analysis (TCA). Finally, the semantic features and metric features are combined and input into the logical regression (LR) classifier for training. The presented TLSTM model performs better on the f-measure indicator than other machine and deep learning models, according to the outcomes of several open-source projects of the PROMISE repository. The TLSTM model built with a single feature achieves 0.7% and 2.1% improvement on Log4j-1.2 and Xalan-2.7, respectively. When using combined features to train the prediction model, we call this model a transfer long short-term memory for defect prediction (DPTLSTM). DPTLSTM achieves a 2.9% and 5% improvement on Synapse-1.2 and Xerces-1.4.4, respectively. Both prove the superiority of the proposed model on the CPDP task. This is because LSTM capture long-term dependencies in sequence data and extract features that contain source code structure and context information. It can be concluded that: (1) the TLSTM model has the advantage of preserving information, which can better retain the semantic features related to software defects; (2) compared with the CPDP model trained with traditional metric features, the performance of the model can validly enhance by combining semantic features and metric features.","","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1049/2024/5550801",""

However, the former exhibited limitations in capturing semantic and structural features, while the latter encountered constraints due to differences in data distribution across projects. Therefore, we introduce a novel framework called improved clustering with graph-embedding-based features (IC-GraF) for SDP without the reliance on historical data.

Unfortunately, all the previous research conducted without effective feature reduction suffers from high-dimensional data, leading to unsatisfactory prediction performance measures. Moreover, without proper feature reduction, the interpretability and generalization ability of machine learning models in SDP may be compromised, hindering their practical utility in diverse software development environments. In this paper, an SDP approach using deep Q-learning network (DQN)-based feature extraction is proposed to eliminate irrelevant, redundant, and noisy features and improve the classification performance. In the data preprocessing phase, the undersampling method of BalanceCascade is applied to divide the original datasets. As the first step of feature extraction, the weight ranking of all the metric elements is calculated according to the expected cross-entropy. Then, the relation matrix is constructed by applying random matrix theory. After that, the reward principle is defined for computing the Q value of Q-learning based on weight ranking, relation matrix, and the number of errors, according to which a convolutional neural network model is trained on datasets until the sequences of metric pairs are generated for all datasets acting as the revised feature set. Various experiments have been conducted on 11 NASA and 11 PROMISE repository datasets. Sensitive analysis experiments show that binary classification algorithms based on SDP approaches using the DQN-based feature extraction outperform those without using it. We also conducted experiments to compare our approach with four state-of-the-art approaches on common datasets, which show that our approach is superior to these methods in precision, F-measure, area under receiver operating characteristics curve, and Matthews correlation coefficient values.","M achine learning , software defect prediction, CNN model , deep learning, metrics","","","9"
